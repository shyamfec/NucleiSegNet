## Goal
To perform nuclei segmentation of the Liver cancer Histopathology Images using deep learning architecture.

## Requirements
All the scripts ran using Tensorflow v2.2 in Google Colab Notebook. So all the required dependencies can be installed using
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
* It is necessary to run the ```pip install spams``` as the stain normalization requires this package.Then you can run the other scripts
* Perform the stain normalization and cropping into patches of 16 (Multi-organ dataset has image size of 1000 x 1000). This will be done by running ``` python color_norm.py```. You can give here the image sizes and path to folders (train,test,valid) and also path where the cropped normalized patches can be saved.
* Then run the ```python main.py``` which will start the training process. It requires path to the saved color normalized patches and various other parametrs. You can change all at the top of the scripts
* For the test, run the ```python test.py``` which will carry out the inference on the test set. But remeber to give the path to your saved weights, model and test image patches.
* For overlaying the mask on the test image, run ```python overlay_mask.py``` . Remember to give the correct path at the start of the script 
* All the scripts, are run together in Google colab, to show how to run the scripts.

## Folder Structure while running the code
The code is built keeping this folder template in mind. So by default this folder sturcture will be created automatically. You need to specify the paths for these folders while running the code.  You can change it but maintain the 'Bin' and 'tis' part for labels and images.
```
Folder Template/

└── TrainData/     - Training data folder containing the stain normalized patches for training
    ├── Bin        - Binary Labels
    ├── tis        - Training images
└── ValidData/     
    ├── Bin
